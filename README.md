# Downloader-and-parser
This Java project downloads the txt files from the site URL: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/summaries/datasets#yearOrdered and Reads the data and gives an output CSV file which contains the required necessary information.

NOTE: all the input and output file is present in the project folder.
      The downlodaded text files are downloaded and stored in the "Downloaded_Data" folder inside project folder 
      Although the code dose it's work properly there are many changes to be made to the code.
      I will soon make changes to the code.
